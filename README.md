# HKCB - Hong Kong Contact Book
 
It is a simple system to find a person's contact in Hong Kong by his/her phone number. The system consists of two parts which are the query part and the result part.
 
## Usage
 
For the query part, only the phone number is required.
 
The contact information includes:
 
- First Name
- Last Name
- Status
- Address
- Gender
- Birthday
- Status
- Email
- Company
 
## Note
 
This is my first practice project using react library. The reason behind using code sandbox ide is that I don't know how to set up a fully functional environment for developing React project. :joy:
